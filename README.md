==============

Game that I made as a project for a Python course at the university.
==============

Behold the game, where the start menu is better than the game!

2D standalone shooter, where you have to kill zombies and stay alive as long as possible. <br>
Zombies multiply and keep comming!

To be able to play you need to have Python 3.3* + the relevant Pygame version. <br>
I wrote it in Python 3.3.5.

Have fun! :)
