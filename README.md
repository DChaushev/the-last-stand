the-last-stand
==============

Game that I made as a project for a Python course at the university.
==============

Behold the game, where the start menu is better than the game!

2D standalone shooter, where you have to kill zombies and stay alive as long as possible.
Zombies multiply and keep comming!

To be able to play you need to have Python 3.3* + the relevant Pygame version.
I wrote it in Python 3.3.5.

Have fun! :)
